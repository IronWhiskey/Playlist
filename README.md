# PlayList

PlayList is a Ruby on Rails project that demonstrates basic REST "representational state transfers" routing and CRUD "Create, READ, UPDATE, DESTROY" database operations with a POSTGRESQL database. The Playlist application has login and registration functionality and allows users to add their favorite songs to their playlist. A main dashboard displays all songs that have been added by users. A user can then add a song to their playlist. everytime a song is added to a playlist the count of that song is incremented by one, thereby showing the popularity of a particular song.
